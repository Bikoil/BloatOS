__If you thought Windows or Ubuntu were the most bloat things you have seen, well say hello to **BLOATOS**__
# What and why??
- Windows and Ubuntu may have been a bit bloat lately, so i thought why not *MORE BLOAT?* this is just a silly little project I am working on, so dont be expecting me to maintain it well
# Elements Expected to be inside the OS
- Pre-installed Bedrock linux (The more PMs, the more bloat!)
- Flatpak + Some Flatpak apps
- Snap apps
- KDE
- Cinnamon
- XFCE
- LXQT
- LXDE
- Useless apt apps
__*THESE HAVE NOT BEEN ADDED YET INTO DEVELOPMENT, THEY WILL BE ADDED ONCE THE OS IS FULLY OUT*__
